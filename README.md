# PointHandler
Object-oriented programming in Python

Objectives
Development of Python modules to solve complex problems
• Develop Python modules and classes
• Work with standard and compound data types in Python
• Use test-driven development
• Familiarize with special libraries e.g. matplotlib

Requirements 
1. Implement a solution for the following problem using classes and feature 
driven development
2. The solution offers a console type interface that allows the user to input 
the data and visualize the output
3. The program uses only the standard and compound data types available in Python

The solution ensures:
• Providing at least 10 data examples in the application
• Documentation and testing of each function
• Validation of data – when the user introduces invalid commands or data, a 
warning should be generated


Problem specification 
A math teacher needs a program that helps students perform simple operations with 
points in two-dimensional space.
The program manages several points (class PointRepository) and allows different operations.

All the additional documentation is provided inside the python modules.
